I am an Integrated MTech-PhD student at IIIT Allahabad. I am working at <a href="https://cvbl.iiita.ac.in">Computer Vision & Biometrics Lab(CVBL)</a> on Vision-Language problems. I completed my Bachelors of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from <a href="https://nerist.ac.in">NERIST, Nirjuli</a>. 

My PhD research focuses on Image/Video Scene Understanding. I have a deep passion for programming, and I explore the latest trends in Computer Vision and Deep Learning research.

Formerly, I worked as a Technical Assistant at the Department of Computer Science & Engineering, NIT Silchar for a year and I also worked as a Project Engineer at the Department of Electronics & Communication Engineering, NIT Silchar.
